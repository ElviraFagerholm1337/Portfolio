                                  <p>I am a passionate graphics designer based in Norrköping, Östergötland, dedicated to bringing visions and creativity to life through visualization.
                                  </p>

                                  <h4>Background</h4>
                                    <p>My journey into graphic design commenced in 2020 when I pursued a bachelor's degree in graphics design and communication at Linköpings Universitet. However, my creative journey began over 20 years ago when, as a child, I constantly had a pysselprojekt and building a lådbil, en flotte eller pilbågar.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>During my studies, I specialized in UX/UI design, delving deeper into UX design with a focus on information architecture. I've also acquired a foundational understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding, along with a course in dynamic web layout. In my final year of studies, I initiated my own company and collaborated with Östegötlands Sjukhusclowner, producing illustrative materials used within their app <i>Clownerna!</i>.
                                    </p>

                                  <h4>Skills and Expertise</h4>
                                    <p>Proficient in Adobe Creative Cloud—specifically Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, After Effects, and Premiere Pro—I prefer using a drawing tablet and Procreate for pixel graphics illustration. My dedication to continual learning and integration of various software enables me to explore the breadth of my creative capabilities.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Throughout my studies, I engaged in projects centered around UX/UI design. Over the past year, I've contributed as a UX designer for Linköpings kommun in the project <i>Mitt Linköping</i>. My experience spans research (both quantitative and qualitative), concept design, Figma prototyping, and further design refinement for development.
                                    </p>

                                      <h4>Professional Achievements</h4>
                                      <p>One of my proudest accomplishments involves in running my own firm and my work with Östergötlands Sjukhusclowner, where I created illustrations of real-life clowns as interactive figures within the app, providing children with exploration and curiosity of the clowns through the game.</p>

                                      <h4>Vision and Goals</h4>
                                      <p>Looking ahead, I envision utilizing my diverse skills to visualize ideas, transforming them from concepts into finished products. I take immense pride in the dedication and energy I invest in my projects, both professionally and personally.
                                      </p>

                                      <h4>Personal Touch</h4>
                                      <p>Beyond illustration, I find joy in crochet knitting, musicals, scuba diving, tattooing, and baking. My prinsesstårta, I believe, is among the best in Sweden. My personal interests complement my professional goals, providing a creative outlet and fostering exploration without constraints.
                                      </p>

                                  <h3>Background</h3>
                                  <p>During my eight-week internship at HiQ, I engaged in a diverse array of responsibilities encompassing 3D graphics, UX design, merchandising design, and the creation of illustrated and animated content for their Instagram platform. But my primary focus centered on contributing to the design solution proposal for a client, where I provided illustrative designs while collaborating with HiQ's programming and animation teams.</p>

                                  <h3>Career Path Development</h3>
                                  <p>Despite HiQ not securing the project, my design approach resonated positively with the client, leading to a direct request for my involvement in their project as an illustrative designer. Subsequently, I established my own firm, solidified a contract, and promptly commenced delivering design concepts and solutions to Östergötlands Sjukhusclowner.
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Professional Contributions</h3>
                                  <p>In my role, I specialize in configuring clown animations within <i>Spine</i>, crafting skins using Procreate and Photoshop, and infusing each clown with distinctive life and personality reflective of the real-life clowns visiting hospitals. These contributions have been integral to the development of <i>Clownerna!</i>-an upcoming national application in Sweden. Notably, my illustrations enhance the 'Wardrobe' minigame within the app, enabling children to creatively dress the clowns in entertaining outfits.
                                  </p>

                               <h2>ESG: Välkommen in</h2>
                               <div class="fullscreen hidden-project-text">
                                 <h3>Background</h3>
                                 <p>During the spring of 2023 me and my partner wrote our bachelor's thesis for East Sweden Game in Norrköping. The purpose of the study was to develop a concept for a campaign that increases awareness about a local gaming community among female and non-binary students with an interest in gaming and game development. The goal of the campaign was to inform the target audience about the existence of the gaming community and encourage them to join and continue exploring their interest for gaming and game development.</p>

                                 <h3>Quantitative & Qualitative research</h3>
                                 <h4>Survey</h4>
                                 <p>As part of the preliminary study, a survey was sent out to the target audience with the aim of exploring how they perceive the design of game marketing today and what the general interest in gaming and game development looks like. </p>

                                 <h4>Interviews</h4>
                                 <p>To gain a deeper insight into the thoughts and opinions of the target audience, we conducted qualitative interviews with two of the respondents from the survey. The purpose of these interviews was to allow the respondents to elaborate on selected questions from the survey, thus providing us with a greater understanding of the target audience.</p>

                                 <h4>Results: User Summary</h4>
                                 <p><i>The user is a female/non-binary student at Linköping University, aged 22-27 years. She is interested in gaming and used to play on a Nintendo console when she was younger, often with siblings. A typical quote from the user might be "A good evening? Wine & board games" or "Gamer? Well, not me, but my younger brother streams or something." For the user to attend an event for women and non-binary individuals interested in gaming, she requires assurance that the event will be well-organized and that there is clear information about what will happen on-site and what she can expect. While the user could attend alone, the likelihood increases if she goes with others she knows. The user feels that the event is successful if she can explore her gaming interest without pressure, alongside like-minded individuals, without feeling the need to perform.</i></p>

                                 <h3>Objective for the Concept Idea</h3>
                                 <p>Effect & UX Goals for the study

                                   1.1 Effect Goal
                                   Our design solution aims to generate curiosity in the user, prompting them to learn more about what ESG is and why they should further explore their interest in gaming.

                                   1.2 Effect Goal
                                   Our design solution aims to foster a sense of inclusion among the target audience, making them feel engaged with the material.

                                   2.1 UX Goal
                                   Our design solution aims to be informative about the location of ESG Norrköping, how to get there, and details about their recurring events.

                                   2.2 UX Goal
                                   Our design solution aims to be user-friendly, ensuring that the target audience easily understands how to use the material.

                                   <h4>Final concept</h4>
                                   <p>
                                   The final concept idea was to create a small businesscard that also was a ESG board game. The board game was the size of a credit card, making it easy to carry. On the back of the card was a map to ESG Norrköping. Our concept also included 3D-printed game pieces representing the favorite games/consoles of the target audience. These pieces could be attached to a keychain and used for the ESG business card. ESG can distribute both cards and game pieces when they are on campus, for example, or during their events. Another feature of the concept was the ability to connect multiple cards to create a larger game board with the option to play together. Different designs for the game board could be created based on ESG's plans for the year, such as the release of a new game.
                                 </p>

                                 <p>To finally tie together the campaign materials, we chose to create posters. The purpose of these was to enhance ESG's visibility on an additional platform. Visually, we decided to build upon the business cards, using the same colors, shapes, and fonts to maintain consistency and clarify their connection. Three different posters were created with the idea that they could be placed both together and separately on various bulletin boards on campus</p>

                                    <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                                    <p>As a UX Designer at LKDATA under the employ of the municipality of Linköping, I played a key role in the "Mitt Linköping" project. This initiative aimed to enhance the experience for residents and businesses when interacting with the municipality, while also streamlining internal processes through automation. The project involved the development of a comprehensive municipality-wide portal, bringing together all e-services into a unified platform. In a logged-in mode, users could conveniently track, supplement, and monitor the status of their matters.</p>

                                    <h3>Contributions and Achievements</h3>
                                    <p>Throughout my involvement in the project, I employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods to establish a solid foundation for the design phases. Collaborating closely with UX designers, IT architects, project leaders, scrum masters, and both front-end and back-end developers, I ensured a holistic approach to user experience. The project, with its user-centric focus, revolves around the residents of Linköping.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>As my role evolved, I took on the responsibility of serving as the UX lead, orchestrating our workflow across different roles within the project group. Additionally, I actively participated in steering committee meetings, contributing a UX perspective to help structure and prioritize project tasks effectively.</p>

                                    <h3>User Testing Methodology</h3>
                                    <p>Throughout the "Mitt Linköping" project, I played a pivotal role in conducting comprehensive user tests to ensure the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the developed solutions. The user testing process was meticulously designed to gather valuable insights, refine designs, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
                                    <h4>1. Planning and Preparation</h4>
                                    <p>Before initiating user tests, careful planning and preparation were paramount. This involved defining clear objectives, selecting appropriate test scenarios, and identifying key performance indicators. Collaborating with stakeholders, I established a testing protocol that aligned with project goals and user expectations.</p>
                                    <h4>2. Recruitment of Participants</h4>
                                    <p>Securing a diverse pool of participants reflective of the intended user base was crucial. I worked closely with the project team to identify potential users, considering factors such as demographics, technological proficiency, and prior experience with similar services. Recruitment methodologies included targeted outreach and leveraging existing user databases.</p>
                                    <h4>3. Execution of User Tests</h4>
                                    <p>Conducting user tests involved both moderated and unmoderated sessions, depending on the nature of the test scenarios. In moderated sessions, participants were guided through predetermined tasks while providing real-time feedback. Unmoderated sessions allowed for more natural interactions, enabling users to navigate the platform independently.</p>
                                    <h4>4. Data Collection and Analysis</h4>
                                    <p>Quantitative and qualitative data were collected during user tests. Metrics such as task success rates, and sustainability usability score provided quantitative insights. Additionally, qualitative feedback, gathered through open-ended questions and observations, offered a nuanced understanding of user experiences.</p>
                                    <h4>5. Iterative Design Process</h4>
                                    <p>Based on the findings from user tests, I actively implemented necessary changes and refinements. The iterative design process ensured that user feedback played a direct role in shaping the final product, resulting in solutions that were not only functional but also resonated with the needs and preferences of the end-users.</p>
                                    <h4>6. Continuous Improvement</h4>
                                    <p>User testing was an ongoing and integral part of the development lifecycle. Regular feedback loops and continuous improvement cycles were established to address evolving user needs and refine the platform iteratively. This approach ensured that the "Mitt Linköping" project remained user-centered and adaptive to changing requirements.</p>
                                    <p>Overall, the user testing process was instrumental in validating design decisions, uncovering potential pain points, and ultimately delivering a product that met the expectations and satisfaction of the residents and businesses of Linköping.</p>

                                    <h3>Component Design Approach</h3>
                                    <p>In the "Mitt Linköping" project, my role in component design focused on creating a unified and functional user experience. I contributed to a robust design system, collaborated with cross-functional teams for seamless integration, and iteratively refined components through prototyping and user feedback. Prioritizing accessibility and scalability, this approach ensured a cohesive and adaptable platform.</p>

                                     <h3>Unveiling Alhems: A Market Communicative Design Journey</h3>
                                     <p>During the Market Communicative Design Project, I collaborated with Alhems Trädgård, a Neapolitan pizzeria in Skellefteå. Owner Hasse envisioned expanding by introducing his homemade gelato into stores, presenting us with the challenge of creating an impactful gelato packaging and strategic branding.</p>

                                     <h3>Navigating Brand Perception: Uncovering Alhems Trädgård's Identity</h3>
                                     <p>Our journey commenced with in-depth brand research. Surveys and interviews revealed a positive perception among existing customers, largely linked to Hasse's presence. However, confusion and inconsistency plagued the brand for those unfamiliar. A clear mission emerged: before delving into gelato packaging, we needed to build a coherent brand for Alhems Trädgård.</p>

                                     <h3>The Birth of Alhems.: Tokig, Öppen, Livfull</h3>
                                     <p>As the creative director, I led a brainstorming workshop where we defined three core values—Tokig (Bonkers), Öppen (Open), Livfull (Vibrant). Proposing a shift to "Alhems" with a period maintained ties to the physical location and established a straightforward identity, echoing Hasse's ethos of transparency and simplicity.
                                     </p>

                                     <h3>Conceptual Evolution: Fönstret</h3>
                                     <p>Presenting three key concepts—Characters, big fonts, and "The Window"—we collectively embraced "The Window" as the anchor for our brand revamp. This concept aimed to provide customers with a transparent view into the creative and vibrant culinary world of Alhems.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>"The Window" became more than a visual concept; it embodied transparency and openness. A carefully curated color palette and imagery language captured the essence of handmade gelato and the restaurant experience, addressing previous brand inconsistencies.
                                     </p>

                                     <h3>Crafting Coherence: Guidelines for a Unified Brand Identity</h3>
                                    <p>To ensure consistency, we developed comprehensive guidelines covering logotypes, fonts, colors, and imagery. A redesigned logo, symbolizing "The Window," served as a symbolic entry point into the world of Alhems, providing a unified and recognizable brand identity.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Transitioning seamlessly into gelato packaging, we retained elements of the newly crafted brand while incorporating the literal "window" concept. Balancing sophistication and approachability, the packaging resonated with both existing and potential customers.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Alhems' Rebirth: A Solid Foundation for Future Growth</h3>
                                    <p>Collaborating with Hasse, we conducted market testing, witnessing an overwhelmingly positive response. Customers expressed a clearer understanding of the brand, increasing interest in trying the gelato and setting the stage for successful expansion.</p>
                                    <p>Beyond addressing gelato packaging needs, our project revitalized the entire Alhems brand, laying a solid foundation for future growth. This transformation illustrates the strategic design thinking that can reshape a brand's perception and ensure sustained success in the market.</p>

                                  <h3>Background</h3>
                                  <p>During my eight-week internship at HiQ, I engaged in a diverse array of responsibilities encompassing 3D graphics, UX design, merchandising design, and the creation of illustrated and animated content for their Instagram platform. But my primary focus centered on contributing to the design solution proposal for a client, where I provided illustrative designs while collaborating with HiQ's programming and animation teams.</p>

                                  <h3>Career Path Development</h3>
                                  <p>Despite HiQ not securing the project, my design approach resonated positively with the client, leading to a direct request for my involvement in their project as an illustrative designer. Subsequently, I established my own firm, solidified a contract, and promptly commenced delivering design concepts and solutions to Östergötlands Sjukhusclowner.
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Professional Contributions</h3>
                                  <p>In my role, I specialize in configuring clown animations within <i>Spine</i>, crafting skins using Procreate and Photoshop, and infusing each clown with distinctive life and personality reflective of the real-life clowns visiting hospitals. These contributions have been integral to the development of <i>Clownerna!</i>-an upcoming national application in Sweden. Notably, my illustrations enhance the 'Wardrobe' minigame within the app, enabling children to creatively dress the clowns in entertaining outfits.

                                <h3>Background</h3>
                                <p>During the spring of 2023 me and my partner wrote our bachelor's thesis for East Sweden Game in Norrköping. The purpose of the study was to develop a concept for a campaign that increases awareness about a local gaming community among female and non-binary students with an interest in gaming and game development. The goal of the campaign was to inform the target audience about the existence of the gaming community and encourage them to join and continue exploring their interest for gaming and game development.</p>

                                <h3>Quantitative & Qualitative research</h3>
                                <h4>Survey</h4>
                                <p>As part of the preliminary study, a survey was sent out to the target audience with the aim of exploring how they perceive the design of game marketing today and what the general interest in gaming and game development looks like. </p>

                                <h4>Interviews</h4>
                                <p>To gain a deeper insight into the thoughts and opinions of the target audience, we conducted qualitative interviews with two of the respondents from the survey. The purpose of these interviews was to allow the respondents to elaborate on selected questions from the survey, thus providing us with a greater understanding of the target audience.</p>

                                <h4>Results: User Summary</h4>
                                <p><i>The user is a female/non-binary student at Linköping University, aged 22-27 years. She is interested in gaming and used to play on a Nintendo console when she was younger, often with siblings. A typical quote from the user might be "A good evening? Wine & board games" or "Gamer? Well, not me, but my younger brother streams or something." For the user to attend an event for women and non-binary individuals interested in gaming, she requires assurance that the event will be well-organized and that there is clear information about what will happen on-site and what she can expect. While the user could attend alone, the likelihood increases if she goes with others she knows. The user feels that the event is successful if she can explore her gaming interest without pressure, alongside like-minded individuals, without feeling the need to perform.</i></p>

                                <h3>Objective for the Concept Idea</h3>
                                <p>Effect & UX Goals for the study

                                  1.1 Effect Goal
                                  Our design solution aims to generate curiosity in the user, prompting them to learn more about what ESG is and why they should further explore their interest in gaming.

                                  1.2 Effect Goal
                                  Our design solution aims to foster a sense of inclusion among the target audience, making them feel engaged with the material.

                                  2.1 UX Goal
                                  Our design solution aims to be informative about the location of ESG Norrköping, how to get there, and details about their recurring events.

                                  2.2 UX Goal
                                  Our design solution aims to be user-friendly, ensuring that the target audience easily understands how to use the material.

                                  <h4>Final concept</h4>
                                  <p>
                                  The final concept idea was to create a small businesscard that also was a ESG board game. The board game was the size of a credit card, making it easy to carry. On the back of the card was a map to ESG Norrköping. Our concept also included 3D-printed game pieces representing the favorite games/consoles of the target audience. These pieces could be attached to a keychain and used for the ESG business card. ESG can distribute both cards and game pieces when they are on campus, for example, or during their events. Another feature of the concept was the ability to connect multiple cards to create a larger game board with the option to play together. Different designs for the game board could be created based on ESG's plans for the year, such as the release of a new game.
                                </p>

                                <p>To finally tie together the campaign materials, we chose to create posters. The purpose of these was to enhance ESG's visibility on an additional platform. Visually, we decided to build upon the business cards, using the same colors, shapes, and fonts to maintain consistency and clarify their connection. Three different posters were created with the idea that they could be placed both together and separately on various bulletin boards on campus</p>
                                <h3>The designs</h3>

                                <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                                <p>As a UX Designer at LKDATA under the employ of the municipality of Linköping, I played a key role in the "Mitt Linköping" project. This initiative aimed to enhance the experience for residents and businesses when interacting with the municipality, while also streamlining internal processes through automation. The project involved the development of a comprehensive municipality-wide portal, bringing together all e-services into a unified platform. In a logged-in mode, users could conveniently track, supplement, and monitor the status of their matters.</p>

                                <h3>Contributions and Achievements</h3>
                                <p>Throughout my involvement in the project, I employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods to establish a solid foundation for the design phases. Collaborating closely with UX designers, IT architects, project leaders, scrum masters, and both front-end and back-end developers, I ensured a holistic approach to user experience. The project, with its user-centric focus, revolves around the residents of Linköping.
                                </p>
                                <p>As my role evolved, I took on the responsibility of serving as the UX lead, orchestrating our workflow across different roles within the project group. Additionally, I actively participated in steering committee meetings, contributing a UX perspective to help structure and prioritize project tasks effectively.</p>

                                <h3>User Testing Methodology</h3>
                                <p>Throughout the "Mitt Linköping" project, I played a pivotal role in conducting comprehensive user tests to ensure the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the developed solutions. The user testing process was meticulously designed to gather valuable insights, refine designs, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
                                <h4>1. Planning and Preparation</h4>
                                <p>Before initiating user tests, careful planning and preparation were paramount. This involved defining clear objectives, selecting appropriate test scenarios, and identifying key performance indicators. Collaborating with stakeholders, I established a testing protocol that aligned with project goals and user expectations.</p>
                                <h4>2. Recruitment of Participants</h4>
                                <p>Securing a diverse pool of participants reflective of the intended user base was crucial. I worked closely with the project team to identify potential users, considering factors such as demographics, technological proficiency, and prior experience with similar services. Recruitment methodologies included targeted outreach and leveraging existing user databases.</p>
                                <h4>3. Execution of User Tests</h4>
                                <p>Conducting user tests involved both moderated and unmoderated sessions, depending on the nature of the test scenarios. In moderated sessions, participants were guided through predetermined tasks while providing real-time feedback. Unmoderated sessions allowed for more natural interactions, enabling users to navigate the platform independently.</p>
                                <h4>4. Data Collection and Analysis</h4>
                                <p>Quantitative and qualitative data were collected during user tests. Metrics such as task success rates, and sustainability usability score provided quantitative insights. Additionally, qualitative feedback, gathered through open-ended questions and observations, offered a nuanced understanding of user experiences.</p>
                                <h4>5. Iterative Design Process</h4>
                                <p>Based on the findings from user tests, I actively implemented necessary changes and refinements. The iterative design process ensured that user feedback played a direct role in shaping the final product, resulting in solutions that were not only functional but also resonated with the needs and preferences of the end-users.</p>
                                <h4>6. Continuous Improvement</h4>
                                <p>User testing was an ongoing and integral part of the development lifecycle. Regular feedback loops and continuous improvement cycles were established to address evolving user needs and refine the platform iteratively. This approach ensured that the "Mitt Linköping" project remained user-centered and adaptive to changing requirements.</p>
                                <p>Overall, the user testing process was instrumental in validating design decisions, uncovering potential pain points, and ultimately delivering a product that met the expectations and satisfaction of the residents and businesses of Linköping.</p>

                                <h3>Component Design Approach</h3>
                                <p>In the "Mitt Linköping" project, my role in component design focused on creating a unified and functional user experience. I contributed to a robust design system, collaborated with cross-functional teams for seamless integration, and iteratively refined components through prototyping and user feedback. Prioritizing accessibility and scalability, this approach ensured a cohesive and adaptable platform.</p>

                                  <h3>Unveiling Alhems: A Market Communicative Design Journey</h3>
                                  <p>During the Market Communicative Design Project, I collaborated with Alhems Trädgård, a Neapolitan pizzeria in Skellefteå. Owner Hasse envisioned expanding by introducing his homemade gelato into stores, presenting us with the challenge of creating an impactful gelato packaging and strategic branding.</p>

                                  <h3>Navigating Brand Perception: Uncovering Alhems Trädgård's Identity</h3>
                                  <p>Our journey commenced with in-depth brand research. Surveys and interviews revealed a positive perception among existing customers, largely linked to Hasse's presence. However, confusion and inconsistency plagued the brand for those unfamiliar. A clear mission emerged: before delving into gelato packaging, we needed to build a coherent brand for Alhems Trädgård.</p>

                                  <h3>The Birth of Alhems.: Tokig, Öppen, Livfull</h3>
                                  <p>As the creative director, I led a brainstorming workshop where we defined three core values—Tokig (Bonkers), Öppen (Open), Livfull (Vibrant). Proposing a shift to "Alhems" with a period maintained ties to the physical location and established a straightforward identity, echoing Hasse's ethos of transparency and simplicity.

                                  <h3>Conceptual Evolution: Fönstret</h3>
                                  <p>Presenting three key concepts—Characters, big fonts, and "The Window"—we collectively embraced "The Window" as the anchor for our brand revamp. This concept aimed to provide customers with a transparent view into the creative and vibrant culinary world of Alhems.
                                  </p>

                                    <img id="hidden-project-img11" src="Project/Alhems/Alhems1.jpg" alt="">
                                  <p>"The Window" became more than a visual concept; it embodied transparency and openness. A carefully curated color palette and imagery language captured the essence of handmade gelato and the restaurant experience, addressing previous brand inconsistencies.
                                  </p>

                                  <h3>Crafting Coherence: Guidelines for a Unified Brand Identity</h3>
                                 <p>To ensure consistency, we developed comprehensive guidelines covering logotypes, fonts, colors, and imagery. A redesigned logo, symbolizing "The Window," served as a symbolic entry point into the world of Alhems, providing a unified and recognizable brand identity.
                                 </p>

                                 <img id="hidden-project-img11" src="Project/Alhems/Alhems4.jpg" alt="">
                                 <p>Transitioning seamlessly into gelato packaging, we retained elements of the newly crafted brand while incorporating the literal "window" concept. Balancing sophistication and approachability, the packaging resonated with both existing and potential customers.
                                 </p>

                                 <h3>Alhems' Rebirth: A Solid Foundation for Future Growth</h3>
                                 <p>Collaborating with Hasse, we conducted market testing, witnessing an overwhelmingly positive response. Customers expressed a clearer understanding of the brand, increasing interest in trying the gelato and setting the stage for successful expansion.</p>
                                 <p>Beyond addressing gelato packaging needs, our project revitalized the entire Alhems brand, laying a solid foundation for future growth. This transformation illustrates the strategic design thinking that can reshape a brand's perception and ensure sustained success in the market.</p>

But my primary focus centered on contributing to the design solution proposal for a client, where I provided illustrative designs while collaborating with HiQ's programming and animation teams.</p>

                                <h3>Career Path Development</h3>
                                <p>Despite HiQ not securing the project, my design approach resonated positively with the client, leading to a direct request for my involvement in their project as an illustrative designer. Subsequently, I established my own firm, solidified a contract, and promptly commenced delivering design concepts and solutions to Östergötlands Sjukhusclowner.

                                <h3>Professional Contributions</h3>
                                <p>In my role, I specialize in configuring clown animations within <i>Spine</i>, crafting skins using Procreate and Photoshop, and infusing each clown with distinctive life and personality reflective of the real-life clowns visiting hospitals. These contributions have been integral to the development of <i>Clownerna!</i>-an upcoming national application in Sweden. Notably, my illustrations enhance the 'Wardrobe' minigame within the app, enabling children to creatively dress the clowns in entertaining outfits.

                                <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                                <p>As a UX Designer at LKDATA under the employ of the municipality of Linköping, I played a key role in the "Mitt Linköping" project. This initiative aimed to enhance the experience for residents and businesses when interacting with the municipality, while also streamlining internal processes through automation. The project involved the development of a comprehensive municipality-wide portal, bringing together all e-services into a unified platform. In a logged-in mode, users could conveniently track, supplement, and monitor the status of their matters.</p>

                                <h3>Contributions and Achievements</h3>
                                <p>Throughout my involvement in the project, I employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods to establish a solid foundation for the design phases. Collaborating closely with UX designers, IT architects, project leaders, scrum masters, and both front-end and back-end developers, I ensured a holistic approach to user experience. The project, with its user-centric focus, revolves around the residents of Linköping.
                                </p>
                                <p>As my role evolved, I took on the responsibility of serving as the UX lead, orchestrating our workflow across different roles within the project group. Additionally, I actively participated in steering committee meetings, contributing a UX perspective to help structure and prioritize project tasks effectively.</p>

                                <h3>User Testing Methodology</h3>
                                <p>Throughout the "Mitt Linköping" project, I played a pivotal role in conducting comprehensive user tests to ensure the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the developed solutions. The user testing process was meticulously designed to gather valuable insights, refine designs, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
                                <h4>1. Planning and Preparation</h4>
                                <p>Before initiating user tests, careful planning and preparation were paramount. This involved defining clear objectives, selecting appropriate test scenarios, and identifying key performance indicators. Collaborating with stakeholders, I established a testing protocol that aligned with project goals and user expectations.</p>
                                <h4>2. Recruitment of Participants</h4>
                                <p>Securing a diverse pool of participants reflective of the intended user base was crucial. I worked closely with the project team to identify potential users, considering factors such as demographics, technological proficiency, and prior experience with similar services. Recruitment methodologies included targeted outreach and leveraging existing user databases.</p>
                                <h4>3. Execution of User Tests</h4>
                                <p>Conducting user tests involved both moderated and unmoderated sessions, depending on the nature of the test scenarios. In moderated sessions, participants were guided through predetermined tasks while providing real-time feedback. Unmoderated sessions allowed for more natural interactions, enabling users to navigate the platform independently.</p>
                                <h4>4. Data Collection and Analysis</h4>
                                <p>Quantitative and qualitative data were collected during user tests. Metrics such as task success rates, and sustainability usability score provided quantitative insights. Additionally, qualitative feedback, gathered through open-ended questions and observations, offered a nuanced understanding of user experiences.</p>
                                <h4>5. Iterative Design Process</h4>
                                <p>Based on the findings from user tests, I actively implemented necessary changes and refinements. The iterative design process ensured that user feedback played a direct role in shaping the final product, resulting in solutions that were not only functional but also resonated with the needs and preferences of the end-users.</p>
                                <h4>6. Continuous Improvement</h4>
                                <p>User testing was an ongoing and integral part of the development lifecycle. Regular feedback loops and continuous improvement cycles were established to address evolving user needs and refine the platform iteratively. This approach ensured that the "Mitt Linköping" project remained user-centered and adaptive to changing requirements.</p>
                                <p>Overall, the user testing process was instrumental in validating design decisions, uncovering potential pain points, and ultimately delivering a product that met the expectations and satisfaction of the residents and businesses of Linköping.</p>

                                <h3>Component Design Approach</h3>
                                <p>In the "Mitt Linköping" project, my role in component design focused on creating a unified and functional user experience. I contributed to a robust design system, collaborated with cross-functional teams for seamless integration, and iteratively refined components through prototyping and user feedback. Prioritizing accessibility and scalability, this approach ensured a cohesive and adaptable platform.</p>

                                <h3>Unveiling Alhems: A Market Communicative Design Journey</h3>
                                <p>During the Market Communicative Design Project, I collaborated with Alhems Trädgård, a Neapolitan pizzeria in Skellefteå. Owner Hasse envisioned expanding by introducing his homemade gelato into stores, presenting us with the challenge of creating an impactful gelato packaging and strategic branding.</p>

                                <h3>Navigating Brand Perception: Uncovering Alhems Trädgård's Identity</h3>
                                <p>Our journey commenced with in-depth brand research. Surveys and interviews revealed a positive perception among existing customers, largely linked to Hasse's presence. However, confusion and inconsistency plagued the brand for those unfamiliar. A clear mission emerged: before delving into gelato packaging, we needed to build a coherent brand for Alhems Trädgård.</p>

                                <h3>The Birth of Alhems.: Tokig, Öppen, Livfull</h3>
                                <p>As the creative director, I led a brainstorming workshop where we defined three core values—Tokig (Bonkers), Öppen (Open), Livfull (Vibrant). Proposing a shift to "Alhems" with a period maintained ties to the physical location and established a straightforward identity, echoing Hasse's ethos of transparency and simplicity.

                                <h3>Conceptual Evolution: Fönstret</h3>
                                <p>Presenting three key concepts—Characters, big fonts, and "The Window"—we collectively embraced "The Window" as the anchor for our brand revamp. This concept aimed to provide customers with a transparent view into the creative and vibrant culinary world of Alhems.
                                </p>

                                  <img id="hidden-project-img11" src="Project/Alhems/Alhems1.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>"The Window" became more than a visual concept; it embodied transparency and openness. A carefully curated color palette and imagery language captured the essence of handmade gelato and the restaurant experience, addressing previous brand inconsistencies.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Crafting Coherence: Guidelines for a Unified Brand Identity</h3>
                               <p>To ensure consistency, we developed comprehensive guidelines covering logotypes, fonts, colors, and imagery. A redesigned logo, symbolizing "The Window," served as a symbolic entry point into the world of Alhems, providing a unified and recognizable brand identity.

                               <p>Transitioning seamlessly into gelato packaging, we retained elements of the newly crafted brand while incorporating the literal "window" concept. Balancing sophistication and approachability, the packaging resonated with both existing and potential customers.

                               <h3>Alhems' Rebirth: A Solid Foundation for Future Growth</h3>
                               <p>Collaborating with Hasse, we conducted market testing, witnessing an overwhelmingly positive response. Customers expressed a clearer understanding of the brand, increasing interest in trying the gelato and setting the stage for successful expansion.</p>
                               <p>Beyond addressing gelato packaging needs, our project revitalized the entire Alhems brand, laying a solid foundation for future growth. This transformation illustrates the strategic design thinking that can reshape a brand's perception and ensure sustained success in the market.</p>

                                          and Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. I admire the art of storytelling and the timeconsuming work of making animations. I've been creating both frame by frame animations in Procreate using pixel art and Adobe After Effects with vector based artwork.</p>
